NAME
----
viz-rgs - starts a remote desktop session using HP's RGS(Remote Graphics Software)


SYNOPSIS
--------
*viz-rgs* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The viz-rgs(1) command starts an interactive remote desktop session
for you. By default, a GPU is picked up automatically for you to use.
You may choose a specific type of GPU, or run an RGS session on a
Tile Display driven from a single node. You may also run RGS with or
without collaboration enabled.

After starting the session, you will need to connect to the session
using the RGS Receiver. The RGS Receiver is typically installed on
your desktop or laptop.

For a better user experience, consider installing and using the
graphical VizStack Remote Access tools.

OPTIONS
-------
*-g, --geometry*='GEOMETRY'::
    The resolution to run the desktop at. This can be any '<width>x<height>'
    formatted value. The geometry does not need to match any display device 
    resolution. Width needs to be a multiple of 8, and <width>x<height> may 
    not be lesser than '304x200'. Note that larger resolutions may result in
    higher network bandwidth usage, CPU utilization and in general, lower
    performance.

*-b, --batch-mode*::
    Use this if you are running this script via a batch scheduler. This will 
    direct the script to allocate resources on the machine where the script
    gets run by the scheduler.

*--gpu-type*='TYPE'::
    Use a specific type of GPU 'TYPE' for this remote session. Note that  
    GPU types will have spaces in it, so you will need to quote the string.

*-t, --tiled-display*='NAME'::
    Use tiled display 'NAME' for the RGS session. This allows a local user
    to collaborate with remote users. If the tiled display uses more than
    one GPUs, then only the first GPU will be remoted. Tiled display 'NAME'
    is also restricted to use resources from a single node.

*-m, --display-mode*='MODE'::
    Use display mode 'MODE' on each tile of the tiled display. Not valid
    without a tiled display.

*-a, --allocate-from*='NODE'::
    Allocate the GPU on host 'NODE'. If you use this option multiple times, 
    then a single GPU from one of the specified hosts will be used. Note that
    the allocation is independent of the order in which the hostnames are 
    specified on the command line. This option cannot be used if -b is used.

*--show-gpu-types*::
    Prints out a list of GPU types that are potentially available for allocation.

*-h, --help*::
    Prints this message.

*--automation*::
    This option is intended for automation use by the VizStack Remote Access 
    tools. Not intended for command line usage.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (unable to allocate resources, termination via
    ^C, any other abnormal termination)


EXAMPLES
--------

To get a desktop running at a default resolution, use

*# viz_rgs*

On success, this will print out the address to which you need
to connect using the RGS Receiver.  Logout of the desktop
when you are done.  Terminating the script by pressing ^C
is also one way to give up the desktop, but this is not
recommended as you may loose work.

To start a desktop at resolution 1144x1000, use

*# viz_rgs -g 1144x1000*

To start the same desktop on a Quadro FX 5800 GPU, you would use

*# viz_rgs --gpu-type="Quadro FX 5800" -g 1144x1000*

To start a desktop on a tiled display, you would use

*# viz_rgs -t WALL*

This will allow you to control the tiled display WALL
using a keyboard and mouse connected to the systems
to which WALL is connected. Users may connect to the
same session (after you permit them), thus allowing
collaboration.

Note that the tiled display WALL needs to be configured 
with a keyboard and a mouse, else the session will not
start.
