The script run-cudabadnwidth-all-gpus.py runs the CUDA Bandwidth
test on all GPUs in your system.

Some setup is needed before it can be run:

1. Each node must have a copy of the NVIDIA CUDA SDK,
   and on the same path. Please compile the C code samples
   so that the bandwidthTest program can be run.

2. Script assumes that CUDA is installed in /usr/local/cuda

The script run-specviewperf9-all-gpus.py runs the SPECViewPerf 9
benchmark on all GPUs in your system.

Some setup is needed before it can be run:

1. Each node must have a copy of SPECViewPerf 9.0

2. SPECViewPerf 9.0 must be located on the same
   path on all the nodes

3. There must be sufficient space in /tmp of each node
   to accomodate <n> copies of SPECViewPerf 9.0.

   Here, <n> is the number of GPUs on each individual
   node.

   Note that the amount of free space needed can be
   quite large. The SPECViewPerf 9.0 directory is
   typically large - e.g. it occupies 1.9 GB in my
   system.

   So, if you have 2 GPUs on a node, then you would
   need 1.9*2 = 3.8 GB of free space

   If you have 4 GPUs on a node, then that node would
   need 1.9*4 = 7.6 GB of free space in /tmp

4. It might be possible to reduce the space needed.
   But this is left as an exercise for the reader !
