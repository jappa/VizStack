# gdm.conf.template
#
# This file is used as a template configuration for GDM. GDM is typically
# used by VizStack with RGS.
#
#  This file was copied off a SLES10 SP2 system.
# ( /etc/opt/gnome/gdm/gdm.conf )
#
# !!!!
#
# WARNING : It will definitely not match any other system. This file is
# supplied as a way to show what customizations need to be done to gdm.conf
# 
# To get RGS to work, you'll need to make the changes mentioned below.
#
# !!!!
#
# At runtime, this is what happens :
#
#  - VizStack starts it's GDM wrapper.
#  - The GDM wrapper reads /etc/vizstack/templates/gdm.conf
#  - The GDM wrapper substitues text in the file
#     - @@USER@@ is replaced with the username for who GDM is 
#       being run
#     - @@UID@@ is replaced with the uid of the user for who GDM is 
#       being run
#  - The replaced file is used to start GDM.
#
# This makes it absolutely essential to take the gdm.conf that is
# right for your Linux distribution. Otherwise, file paths and other
# defaults will not be correct.
# 
# On the various distributions, the place where the GDM config file
# are kept is
#
# SLES 10 SP2 - /etc/opt/gnome/gdm/gdm.conf
# RHEL 5.x - /usr/share/gdm/defaults.conf
#
# You need to copy the right file (according to your distribution) into 
# /etc/vizstack/templates/gdm.conf, and then make a few changes manually.
#
# The configurations that are relevant to VizStack are 
#  - "AutoLoginEnable" is set to "true"
#  - "AutomaticLogin" is set to "@@USER@@"
#  - in the [Server-Standard] section, 
#      "command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -audit 0 -br"
#    is converted to
#      "command=/usr/X11R6/bin/vs-X -audit 0 -br --rgs-prompt-user --server-for @@UID@@"
#  - "AllowShutdown" is set to "false" to avoid
#    showing the Shutdown button if you ever choose to
#    use the GDM screen. We don't want random users to
#    shutdown machines !
#
#

# GDM Configuration file.  You can use gdmsetup program to graphically
# edit this, or you can optionally just edit this file by hand.  Note that
# gdmsetup does not tweak every option here, just the ones most users
# would care about.  Rest is for special setups and distro specific
# tweaks.  If you edit this file, you should send the HUP or USR1 signal to
# the daemon so that it restarts: (Assuming you have not changed PidFile)
#   kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/gdm.pid`
# (HUP will make gdm restart immediately while USR1 will make gdm not kill
# existing sessions and will only restart gdm after all users log out)
#
# You can also use the gdm-restart and gdm-safe-restart scripts which just
# do the above for you.
#
# For full reference documentation see the gnome help browser under
# GNOME|System category.  You can also find the docs in HTML form on
# http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/
#
# NOTE: Some of these are commented out but still show their default values.
# If you wish to change them you must remove the '#' from the beginning of
# the line.  The commented out lines are lines where the default might
# change in the future, so set them one way or another if you feel
# strongly about it.
