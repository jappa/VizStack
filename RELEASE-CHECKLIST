Apply the following checks to packages before a release :

- ALL files are present in the release:
  - Scripts
  - Template files and XML definitions
  - Documentation
    - Man pages
    - HTML, PDF docs
  
- Package installs fine
  - Check version numbers
  - Run minimum checks

- Run tests from the test directory. If something fails, there 
  must be a good explanation for the failure.

- Check the dependencies reported by the package. This list should match expectations.
