Use the native package installation command to install
the VizStack package.

E.g., on RedHat, SLES, Fedora Core use 'rpm'
On Ubuntu and Debian use 'dpkg'

VizStack runs well after installation on many distros.

However, I ran into some problems on Ubuntu server.
This does not install a desktop environment by default,
so I had to install many needed packages by hand.

Ubuntu Server:

1. xinit
2. xserver-xorg-input-void (for X server driver "void")
3. mesa-utils (for glxinfo)
4. x11-xserver-utils (for xhost)
5. gdm (for desktop sessions)
6. xfonts-base : This provides the 'fixed' font needed by TurboVNC server.
                 If you dont install this, then you will not be able to start
                 TurboVNC sessions using viz-tvnc.
