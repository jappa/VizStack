"""
vs-generate-authfile

Purpose of this script : generate an auth file which can be used to access a specific X server.

The input arguments are :
1 -> DISPLAY
2 -> input auth file, passed to vs-X as "-auth"
3 -> output auth file, typically in /var/run/vizstack.

This script extracts the first MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 from the auth file and 
creates the output file to access the X server using that.
